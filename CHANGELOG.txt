## [Major Reformism v2.5] ()
* FIXED THE GAME-BREAKING BUG: Revolt/Reform not resetting public opinion
* Made most in-game text sizes consistent across different resolutions / font-size less dependent on screen resolution
* Fixed some minor dynamic font scaling / text scaling flaws: Text on higher DPI/resolution displays glitched and became illegible. This shouldn't break that easily anymore. **If this still happens, do let me know!**
* Fixed a bug to do with country emotes, that caused the game to freeze randomly after playing 
* The Neoliberal policy is now used on your own populace instead of other countryballs
* Fixed inconsistent cursor selection in the IdeologyDex when hovering over ideologies
* Gigantic optimization, halved the amount of GameObjects present in-game. 


## [Minor Reformism v2] (20-07-2022)

### CONTENT
* Added 2 new policies:
	- Added "Special Military Operation"
	- Added "The Neoliberal"
* Added 2 new ideologies: Eco-Posadism, Titoism
* Playing as an internationalist makes you more frequently in tune with/aware of the emotions of other countryballs. They show their opinions of you automatically, more often
* The PlayerID scales (at the left) are now more directly linked with the real-time values. 
More responsive and coherent, it shows the effects of each question more clearly
* The 'Z' key can now also be used as a shortcut for changing the game view / zooming in

### Buffs / Nerfs
* Buffed effectivity of Redirective Institutional Facility (Not Gulag) & Death Flights policies by 10% 
* Decreased the war turns of Tribal War from 10, to 7
* Radical Centrist now has a 25% chance of changing its favourite propaganda value, when answering a question
* Getting the CopyCat policy multiple times, in the same playthrough, is now significantly harder
* CopyCat now also updates the compass position immediately

### FIXES
* Fixed a typo in the description of Apoliticism 
* Fixed the conflation of 'Universal' and 'World' within the sorting of the IdDex, it is now the same 
* Copycat bug is now resolved (or so I think, if not do notify me!)
* Fixed the Ideological Assessment navigation arrows being unresponsive
* Citizen reactions should now be less inconsistent. However do note, that the public opinion is based on the 4-dimensional distance to your ideology, NOT the specific questions.
* Slightly increased scrollspeed in scrolling menus 
* The Diplomatic Win Ending (Geopolitical Stability) now only checks for the conditions after executing a diplomatic policy. This, so it occurs less randomly.

### OPTIMIZATION
* EndState check happens less frequently, and is more streamlined!
* All ideologies are now cached as texture resources, greatly reducing in-game lag!
* Compressed and optimized the build size, reducing all texture file sizes for faster game boot-up time
* Misc code cleanups

### MISC
* "You're too apolitical to answer questions!"
* "Zoom out to use your policies" 
* Extremism bias default value increased to 0.75 in ideological assessment
* Reduced the Ideological Assessment results to 7 tiers
* UI View toggle is now positioned at the bottom-right corner of the screen (& other minor UI changes)
