# 👀 BAD OPTICS! 👨🏻
🧠💭🎩🏴‍☠️💸

_“Politicians are specifically tailored to connect and relate as much as possible with the populus,
or are they?” 👔👨🏻_



Using 8values, altvalues, and a range of political tests, this game ultimately acts as
a __‘Gamified Political Compass’__

This game is built on a nihilism towards the subjectivity of politics, the virtue signalling of political movements despite most of them resulting in imperfect government systems and/or more polarisation.

_You can’t please everyone,
...but wanna try? 👀_


The faith of the political climate is now within your hands!
BAD OPTICS soon available for desktop, on [CanPixel.com](https://canpixel.com/projects.php)
