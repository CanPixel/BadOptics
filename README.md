_‚ÄúYour job is specifically to connect and relate as much as possible with your populus. That, or do whatever‚Äù üëîüë®üèª_



Using 8values, altvalues, and a range of political tests, this game ultimately acts as
a __‚ÄòGamified Political Compass‚Äô__

Ooh, the subjectivity of politics, the virtue signalling of political movements, all that despite most of them resulting in imperfect government systems and possibly more polarisation.

_You can‚Äôt please everyone,
...but would you try? üëÄ_


The faith of the political climate is now within your hands!

_Combining [8values](https://github.com/8values/), [altvalues](https://github.com/altvalues/), [infvalues](https://github.com/infvalues/), [9axes](https://github.com/9axes/), Jreg's 100 dimensional political compass, and the polcompball wiki into one ideologically exciting, anti-centrist game experience!_
